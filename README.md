# Book Store Project

This is a **Book Store** application built using **Microservices Architecture** as part of a learning project to understand how to design and develop scalable and modular applications using **Spring**, **Thymeleaf**, and **MySQL**. The application follows a microservices pattern, where different functionalities (such as user management, book catalog, and orders) are handled by separate services that communicate with each other.

The goal of this project is to learn how to build a **distributed system** with **Spring Boot**, use **RESTful APIs** for communication between microservices, and store data in **MySQL**.

## Key Concepts

This project introduces the following concepts:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Building independent services that are loosely coupled and can be deployed and scaled individually.
- **Spring Boot**: Using Spring Boot to create stand-alone, production-ready microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: Utilizing Spring Cloud for service discovery, configuration, and inter-service communication.
- **Thymeleaf**: Rendering dynamic views in the front-end.
- **MySQL**: Using MySQL as a database for persistent storage.
- **API Gateway**: A central gateway to route requests to different microservices (optional, if implemented in the future).
